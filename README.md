# Volume-control-using-Hand-Gestures
<b><i>Hand gestures are most commonly used in day-to-day life (sign language) and hand
gestures are powerful communication mode for Human Computer Interaction (HCI). In general,
we use keyboard control, traditional mouse and joystick to interact with computer, by using this
project we can interact with computer through sign language (Gestures).
In the primary step system should detect the gesture, for detection purpose user may need either
hand gloves or webcam (to capture the image). The visual based system model requires camera
and an algorithm which helps user to control the volume.</b></i>
